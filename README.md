APS Simulation Tool

This Springboot project implements a full simulation suite for Artificial Pancreas Systems.
The whole logic of the web app is inside the folder src/main/kotlin/com.example.APS_simulation_tool
The web app runs on localhost on port :8090
All the components needed for the simulation are inside the folder src/.../com.example.APS_simulation_tool/components.
I hope the rest is clear by the package names.

HTML-sites:
All html files are inside the folder src/.../resources/templates .
When the names begin with "f-" (for fragment) they are being imported into another html file.
